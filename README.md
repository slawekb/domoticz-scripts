# Scripts for Domoticz
## About
Domoticz is this cool, opensource Home Automation system, go to https://www.domoticz.com for details.
These are some automation scripts that I use in my Domotcz installation, I decided to share them in the hope that they may be useful, and as a kind of thank you to others that have shared their work and ideas, and by that helped me to build my system.

I have used some ideas and bits of code from others, so you're also welcome to use and modify these scripts.
